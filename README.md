# Oil_And_Gas_Visualizations

### Oil Prices


The oil and gas industry has recovered from nearly a decade of turmoil. However, analysts predict that the recovery will be uneven across the industry in the coming years. Frac spreads have increased since 2020 but have stabilized in recent months. The rig count has also stabilized, with the Permian Basin seeing the most drilling and accounts for almost half of the activity in the US. Wells that were drilled but left uncompleted (DUCs) for a time when energy prices would be higher acts as a kind of underground storage. These have reached multi-year lows due to higher energy prices and low investment by producers. It's uncertain if DUC inventory will rebound if energy prices remain low as producers need to increase activity just to maintain production and the rig count is rising but at a slower pace than many recoveries. 

Crude storage has risen by less than 50 million barrels, which is unusual as crude builds up by nearly 100 million barrels in most years. Over the short term, oil prices look promising as storage is low, and OPEC has indicated that it's not defending market share through its surprise 1 MMbpd cut. Just the fact that OPEC cut production is a long-term bearish signal. Why would the organization cut production if the market is balanced? They could be trying to push prices into the stratosphere or they could be worried about consumption. Also, the way the organization cut production is questionable. Usually OPEC plans a meeting to discuss future production and then plans a cut but this time, a few producers met in secrete and planned a cut over a period of just a few days. 

The 50 million barrel build-up in crude storage will be worked off during the summer, and the SPR won't help consumers as it's already at multi-year lows. Gasoline storage is low for this time of year, and distillate storage is close to recent record lows for this time of year.
OPEC+ seems to be in control as they can manipulate crude prices while the West imports Russian barrels through various "blends" or indirectly through Middle Eastern producers that consume Russian crude which frees up Middle East producers to ship their crude to America or Europe.
Russia claims that it has found a home for all of its crude barrels in Africa, India, and China, but it means that Russia is now competing with Iran and Venezuela for market share in these regions. This will likely cause a small amount of friction but is unlikely to rankle relations between these countries. This will cause some economic pain which could lead to some destabilization in their respective regions which could affect crude prices in the future.

These factors are probably why the market is forcasing lower oil prices. The oil volatility skew above shows that the market is willing to pay to protect the downside from risks as the "smile" appears to be more of a smirk.

Even oil is starting to flirt with contango as future prices are expected to be as high as current prices are now. This being said, the $70 to $85 range is still fantastic for the industry and returns are expected to be above the market average if prices remain in this range.

That being said, the market is expecing crude prices to steadly fall in the future and this is likely to be because electric vehicles will reduce consumption.

My prediction for the market would be that oil remains above $60 and will likely remain between $80 and $90 during the summer if the economy is struggling. Consumers are not willing to pay higher gasoline prices when they cannot afford to own their vehicles. This will cap higher prices even if the economy does avoid a major recession.


### Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas appears to be facing headwinds as a warmer winter dashed producers expectations for a catastrophic winter. Natural gas storage usually drops in the summer as demand is low and rises in the winter as more gas is used for heating. This year, natural gas storage is near the upper boudn of the dip for the 5 year average. Producers were expecting prices to remain at record levels in Europe and Japan over the winter but have fallen to around $15/MMbtu due to warmer prices. 

Henry Hub prices are already in contango and it is likely to get worse over the summer. If the winter is relatively normal in 2023 prices will likely rise for Henry Hub, the Dutch TTF, and the JKM. Some of the mitigating factors in the winter of 2022 were numerous take or pay contracts that were diverted from China to Japan and Europe which helped bouy storage and clamp down on prices. China has emerged from Covid and will likely consume the natural gas that was diverted which will likely push up prices over the winter.

Natural gas prices will likely remain in a $3 to $5 range for the foreseable future as demand will tick up and export capacity will reduce the seasonality of prices. China is planning to add 500 coal powerplants ( the CO2 emissions will likely match the United State's total current output today) in the next few years. Also, Russia will get eventally get its natural gas to market in one way or another. This could be through pipelines across the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts to link up with Central Asian natural gas infrastructure that leads to China or pipelines that cross DongBei that end up in Beijing. This could either displace Central Asian natural gas that could go to Europe or excess Russian natural gas could be piped to China's coast. China's import LNG terminals could be configured to become export LNG terminals similar to what happend in the US when the country first started exporint LNG. This is assuming that Europe does not import Russian natural gas through the Ukraine, Russia either develops its own LNG export terminals (which would require it to get technology from Europe, the US or China) or build Nord Stream 3 under the Baltic Sea, and there is always the Turkstream pipeline into southern Europe. 

Either way, Russia will likely get its natural gas to market and they will not be the only one. Qatar will reach 126 metric tons of LNG capacity by 2027 which will flood the market and add to downward price of natural gas. While both Russia and Qatar will likely increase export capacity, American natural gas producers will take this as a challenge. They are already gearing up to add export capacity and will likely continue to vie for the title of the largest LNG exporter.

This is likely what is pushing the market to forcast turbulance in the natural gas market. The volatility skew above is for natural gas prices and indicates that the market is willing to overpay to protect it against downside risks even though prices remain just above $2.

Future prices are expected to rise but the commodity is so seasonal that prices always rise in the summer. If the world experiences another warm winter it could cause the market to expect lower prices as the Ukranian conflict will likely be resolved in the next year.

Dutch TTF prices are already coming down are expected to be around $15 MMbtu or around 40 Euros for the metric equivalent.

And the JKM price shows higher prices over the winter which usually happens.

And for the market's expectations for Henry Hub prices is high as more export capacity will cause domestic prices to rise and normalize with international prices.




### Headwinds for the Economy
Despite the promising crude fundamentals, the global economy appears fragile. The US has been signaling a recession for nearly a year as the Yield Curve has been negative since the Fed raised interest rates. The money supply has been slowly decreasing from recent highs which means that liquidity is finally starting to dry up which will lead to lower interest rates. This could allow the Fed cover for lowering interest rates now that inflation is set to decline but this will be likely be too late for most banks as they are struggling with deposits which will lead to more pressure on the economy.

The difference between a taper tantrum and a recession seems to be a lack of confidence in the industry. The failures of the SVB and a few regional banks have either caused a lack of confidence or has just exposed it to the general public. Tech companies have laid off employees, and even large banks have seen a decline in their customer’s deposits. Not only are banks having to fight for deposits by paying higher interest rates and borrowing money from the Fed Window for a higher rate, they are also having to deal with potential defaults. Some banks have exposure to the housing market directly through loans but most have invested in MBS which could be tough with declining home prices. They are also exposed to auto loans and as the market cools this could cause a melt down.

The US is not the only one struggling with its economy. Europe has been struggling with higher commodity prices, supply chain issues, and blackouts that have disrupted its economy and has collapsed its economy. Europe's economy may have a modest recovery, but if the US falls into a recession, Europe could have a double dip recession or slower growth for years. 

China has also faced challenges due to Covid lockdowns and President Pooh’s lifetime status as leader of China. China has controlled inflation by crippling its real estate, tech, and education sectors. The country likely experience some deflation although its officially barely eked out some inflation. Its manufacturing sector may recover slightly as American companies diversify their production to prepare for the possibility of mainland China trying to take the Republic of China. China has backed Russia at all costs in a losing war which will divert resources away from growth and a day does not go by without 3 different politicians from all political spectrums criticizing China in some way. Not only is China facing these headwinds, but an economy never does also well under a dictator and President Xi appears to be more focused on taking on the West and less on growth like previous presidents. 

None of this means that the world economy will grind to a halt but a clearer picture of where we are headed will surface after Q2 earnings. The SVB collapse and the turmoil will take their toll on the economy and the effects will be evident in Q2 earnings in July. This will allow investors and companies to determine what these effects will be on American companies and they can determine where to invest their money in the future.
