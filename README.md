### Oil Prices

The oil and gas industry has recovered from nearly a decade of turmoil. However, analysts predict that the recovery will be uneven across the industry in the coming years. There are many fundamental factors that support the market and many factors that will keep the market in check. Frac spreads have increased since 2020 but have stabilized in recent months. The rig count has also stabilized, with the Permian Basin seeing the most drilling and accounting for almost half of the activity in the US. Wells that were drilled but left uncompleted (DUCs) for a time when energy prices would be higher, act as a kind of underground storage. The DUC inventory has reached multi-year lows due to higher energy prices and low investment by producers. It's uncertain if DUC inventory will rebound if energy prices remain low as producers need to increase activity just to maintain production and the rig count is rising but at a slower pace than many recoveries.

Crude storage has risen by less than 50 million barrels, which is lower than most years where the build-up is nearly 100 million barrels. Over the short term, oil prices look promising as storage is low, and OPEC has indicated that it's not defending market share through its surprise 1 MMbpd cut. Just the fact that OPEC cut production is a long-term bearish signal. Why would the organization cut production if the market is balanced? They could be trying to push prices into the stratosphere or they could be worried about consumption. Also, the way the organization cut production is questionable. Usually, OPEC plans a meeting to discuss future production and then plans a cut but this time, a few producers met in secret and planned a cut over a period of just a few days. Either way, it's an indication that the producers are not as confident as they should be going into the summer with such low crude supplies.

The 50 million barrel build-up in crude storage will be worked off during the summer, and the SPR won't help consumers as it's already at multi-year lows. Crude storage is in green and the SPR is in black. The vertical lines are when President Trump and President Biden took office. This graph shows the history of crude storage and the dramatic effects of the SPR drawdown. This is pushing up crude prices as the market probably sees that there is very little support in the world if production drops off.

Gasoline storage is low for this time of year, and distillate storage is close to recent record lows for this time of year. Both storage volumes are extremely seasonal and refiners like to build up supplies before the summer driving season. This year storage levels are lower due to higher crude prices. Refiners are probably waiting for crude prices to drop before building up volumes and this summer will see higher prices. 


OPEC+ seems to be in control as they can manipulate crude prices while the West imports Russian barrels through various "blends" or indirectly through Middle Eastern producers that consume Russian crude which frees up Middle East producers to ship their crude to America or Europe. Russia claims that it has found a home for all of its crude barrels in Africa, India, and China, but it means that Russia is now competing with Iran and Venezuela for market share in these regions. This will likely cause a small amount of friction but is unlikely to rankle relations between these countries. This will cause some economic pain which could lead to some destabilization in their respective regions which could affect crude prices in the future.

These factors are probably why the market is forecasting lower oil prices. The oil volatility skew above shows that the market is willing to pay to get protection from the downside risks as the "smile" appears to be more of a smirk.

Even oil is starting to flirt with contango when future prices are expected to be higher than prices are now. This being said, the $70 to $85 range is still fantastic for the industry and returns are expected to be above the market average if prices remain in this range.

The market is expecting crude prices to steadily fall in the long-term future and this is likely because electric vehicles will reduce consumption. My prediction for the market would be that oil remains above $60 and will likely remain between $80 and $90 during the summer if the economy is struggling. Consumers are not willing to pay higher gasoline prices when they cannot afford to own their vehicles. This will cap higher prices even if the economy does avoid a major recession. OPEC+ seems to be defending prices and is content to keep prices above $70/bbl so this will keep prices higher even if demand begins to drop off.


### Natural Gas Prices

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66137235/233897107-ce6cb073-cb9f-49cc-9567-d25c1492e18a.png)

Natural gas appears to be facing headwinds as a warmer winter dashed producer’s expectations for a catastrophic 2022 winter. Natural gas storage usually drops in the summer as demand is low and rises in the winter as more gas is used for heating. This year, natural gas storage is near the upper bound of the typical summer dip for the 5-year average. Producers were expecting prices to remain at record levels in Europe and Japan over the winter but have fallen to around $15/MMbtu due to warmer prices. 

Henry Hub prices are already in contango and it is likely to get worse over the summer. If the winter is relatively normal in 2023 prices will likely rise for Henry Hub, the Dutch TTF, and the JKM. Some of the mitigating factors in the winter of 2022 were numerous take-or-pay contracts that allowed LNG cargos to be diverted from China to Japan and Europe which helped buoy storage and clamp down on prices. China has emerged from Covid and will likely consume the natural gas that was diverted which will likely push up prices over the winter.

Natural gas prices will likely remain in a $3 to $5 range for the foreseeable future as demand will tick up and export capacity will reduce the seasonality of prices. China is planning to add 500 coal power plants (the CO2 emissions from the power plants will likely match the United State's total current CO2 output today) in the next few years. Also, Russia will get eventually get its natural gas to market in one way or another. This could be through new pipelines across the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts to link up with Central Asian natural gas infrastructure that leads to China or new pipelines that cross DongBei that terminate in Beijing. This could either displace Central Asian natural gas that could be rerouted to Europe or excess Russian natural gas could be piped to China's coast. China's import LNG terminals could be configured to become export LNG terminals similar to what happened in the US when the country first started exporting LNG. This is assuming that Russia either develops its own LNG export terminals (which would require it to get technology from Europe, the US, or China) or build Nord Stream 3 under the Baltic Sea, and there is always the Turkstream pipeline into southern Europe as well as Ukrainian pipelines. 

Either way, Russia will likely get its natural gas to market and they will not be the only one. Qatar will reach 126 metric tons of LNG capacity by 2027 which will flood the market and push down the price of natural gas. While both Russia and Qatar will likely increase export capacity, American natural gas producers will take this new export capacity as a challenge. They are already gearing up to add export capacity and will likely continue to vie for the title of the largest LNG exporter.

This is likely what is pushing the market to forecast turbulence in the natural gas market. The volatility skew above is for natural gas prices and indicates that the market is willing to overpay to protect it against downside risks even though prices remain just above $2.

Future prices are expected to rise but the commodity is so seasonal that prices always rise in the summer. If the world experiences another warm winter it could cause the market to expect lower prices as the Ukrainian conflict will likely be resolved in the next year.

Dutch TTF prices are already coming down and are expected to be around $15 MMbtu.

And the JKM price shows higher prices over the winter, which is the norm, but falls again after the winter is over.

And for the market's expectations for Henry Hub prices is high as more export capacity will cause domestic prices to rise and normalize with international prices.

Overall the domestic market will likely remain between the $3 to $5 range on average over the winter. This summer may be particularly hard on natural gas prices especially if the economy struggles to gain traction. Long-term prices will likely remain high the market will try to balance higher international prices and lower domestic prices. The commodity is driven by seasonality but may stabilize as more export terminals are added.




### Headwinds for the Economy

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66137235/233899624-8e286174-d62f-4ed1-9d1e-738b28bf0e08.png)

Despite the promising crude fundamentals, the global economy appears fragile. The US has been signaling a recession for nearly a year as the Yield Curve has been negative since the Fed raised interest rates. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66137235/233899679-dba7aefe-1fcb-4b11-8a7c-10213937660f.png)

The money supply has been slowly decreasing from recent highs which means that liquidity is finally starting to dry up. This will lead to lower interest rates once inflation is tamed by the end of the year. This will allow the Fed cover for justifying lowering interest rates now that inflation is set to decline but this will likely be too late for many sectors in the economy which will lead to more pressure on the economy.

The difference between a taper tantrum and a recession seems to be a lack of confidence in the industry. The failures of the SVB and a few regional banks have either caused a lack of confidence or has just exposed it to the general public. The market can see this in full force as demand for 1-month treasuries has skyrocketed. Also, Tech companies have laid off employees and even large banks are struggling as they have seen a decline in their customer’s deposits. Not only are banks having to fight for deposits by paying higher interest rates, but borrowing costs have also skyrocketed as they are getting money from the Fed Window which has a higher interest rate. Banks are also having to prepare for potential defaults. Some banks have exposure to the housing market directly through loans but most have invested in MBS which could be tough with declining home prices. They are also exposed to auto loans and as the market cools this could cause a meltdown. And when banks struggle, they fail to lend money which reduces liquidity.

The US is not the only one struggling with its economy. Europe has been struggling with higher commodity prices, supply chain issues, and blackouts that have disrupted its economy and collapsed its economy. Europe's economy may have a modest recovery, but if the US falls into a recession, Europe could have a double-dip recession or slower growth for years. 

China has also faced challenges due to Covid lockdowns and President XiJingPing’s lifetime role as the leader of new China. China has controlled inflation by crippling numerous sectors of its economy including its real estate, tech, and education sectors. The country likely experience some deflation although it officially barely eked out some inflation. Its manufacturing sector may recover but American companies will diversify their production away from China to prepare for the possibility of mainland China trying to take the Republic of China. China has also backed Russia at all costs in a losing war which will divert resources away from growth. This backing of Russia's war against the Ukraine has rankled many Americans and has led politicians to criticize the country in public. A day does not go by without 3 different politicians from all political spectrums criticizing China in some way. This is different from normal years as politicians like Janet Yellen have begun to criticize China in public. Not only is China facing these headwinds, but an economy never does also well under a dictator and President Xi appears to be more focused on taking on the West and less on growth than previous presidents. 

And if the world needed another issue, the US government will likely reduce spending through budget talks. The Republicans will likely get some kind of spending reduction which will reduce liquidity in the market and reduce the likelihood of a bailout.

None of this means that the world economy will grind to a halt but investors will get a clearer picture of where we are headed after Q2 earnings in the summer. The SVB collapse and the turmoil will take their toll on the economy and the effects will be evident in Q2 earnings in July. Investors can see how companies will fair with a slower economy and can efficiently pick winners and losers in the market. This will allow investors and companies to determine what these effects will be on American companies and they can determine where to invest their money in the future.
