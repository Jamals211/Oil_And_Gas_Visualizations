# Oil_And_Gas_Visualizations

The oil and gas industry has bounced back from nearly a decade of turmoil in 2022 and analysts predict that the recovery will be uneven throughout the industry over the next few years. Frac spreads are up from 2020 but growth has stabalized in the last few months. The rig count has stablized with the Permian Basin making up the lion's share of the rigs in the country where nearly half the rigs are located. Wells that have been drilled but lefted uncomcompleted (DUCs) for a time with higher energy prices have hit a multi-year low in 2022 and its uncertain whether these will rebound if energy prices dont rebound due to the low rig count. Crude storage has risen by less than 50 MMbbls which is unusual as most years crude builds by nearly 100 MMbbls.

Oil looks promising over the short term as storage is low and OPEC has signaled to the market that it is not defending market share by its surprise 1,000,000 bpd cut. The 50 MMbbl build in storage will be worked off over the summer and the SPR will look like it wont be any help to consumers as its already at multi-year lows. Gasoline storage is low for this time of year and distillate storage is near record lows for this time of year. 

OPEC+ appears to be in the driver's seat as they can manipulate crude prices while the West is content to import Russian barrels through various "blends" that have popped up on the market or indirectly through Middle Eastern producers that consume Russian crude which frees up their crude which can be shipped to America or Europe. 

Russia has said that it has found a home for all of its barrels of crude in Africa, India, and China but that means that Russia is now competing with Iran and Venezuela for market share in these various regions.

While crude fundamentals indicate higher prices in the future, the state of the global economy looks fragile at best. The US has been signaling a recession for months as the Yield Curve has been negative since the Fed has raised interest rates. The money supply has been slowly coming down from recent highs and deposits has been dropping steadily over the banking industry. 

The pivot between a taper tantrum and a recession seems to be a lack of confidence in the industry. The failures of the SVB and a few regional banks has caused a lack of confidence. Tech companies have added to their layoffs and even large banks have seen their deposits decline. Banks have some exposure to the housing market as they have been investing in MBS but where they are most exposed is in auto loans which will likely melt down and suck more liquidity out of the market. 

Europe has been struggling with high commodity prices and blackouts and China has had its own issues with Covid lockdowns. Europe's economy will probably make a modest recovery but if the US is poised to dip into a recession then Europe will probably have a double dip recession or at least have years of slower growth. China has conqured inflation as the country has cripplied its real estate sector, tech sector, education sector, and its manufacturing sector will probably have a modest recovery as American companies will diverisfy their production in case mainland China decides to try to take the Republic of China.

Natural gas appears to be facing headwinds as a warmer winter dashed producers expectations for a catastrophic winter. Natural gas storage usually drops in the summer as demand is low and rises in the winter as more is used for heating but this year natural gas storage is near the upper 5 year bound. Producers were expecting prices to remain at record levels in Europe and Japan over the winter but have fallen to around $15/MMbtu due to warmer prices. 

Henry Hub prices are already in contango and it is likely to get worse over the summer. If the winter is relatively normal in 2023 prices will likely rise for Henry Hub, the Dutch TTF, and the JKM. Some of the mitigating factors in the winter of 2022 were numerous take or pay contracts that were diverted from China to Japan and Europe which helped bouy storage and clamp down on prices. China has emerged from Covid and will likely consume the natural gas that was diverted which will likely keep prices in a normal range. 

Natural gas prices will likely remain in a $3 to $5 range for the foreseable future as China is planning to add 500 coal powerplants (the CO2 emissions will likely match the United State's current emissions) in the next few years. Also, Russia will get its natural gas to market. This could be through pipelines across the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts or DongBei to link up with Central Asian natural gas infrastructure that leads to China. This could either displace Central Asia natural gas that would go to Europe or it could be piped to China's coast where import LNG terminals could be configured to be export LNG terminals which is similar to what happend in the US.  This is assuming that Europe does not import Russian natural gas through the Ukraine, another pipeline under the Baltics, or through Turkey. 

Either way, Russia will likely get its natural gas to market and they will not be the only one. Qatar will reach 126 metric tons by 2027 which will flood the market and add to downward price of natural gas. While both Russia and Qatar will likely increase export capacity, American natural gas producers will take this as a challenge. They are already gearing up to add export capacity and will likely continue to vie for the title of the largest LNG exporter.
